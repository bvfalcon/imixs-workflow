Imixs-Workflow is an open source workflow engine to build human-centric workflow applications on a flexible and robust framework. 
Using the Business Process Modelling Notation - BPMN 2.0, business logic can be modeled fast, easy and in a flexible way. 
Imixs-Workflow is based on the [Jarkarta EE](https://jakarta.ee/) and the [Eclipse Microprofile](https://microprofile.io/) standards and fits into any modern microservice architecture thanks to its openness. Imixs-Workflow runs on all modern application servers like [Wildfly](https://wildfly.org/), [Payara](https://www.payara.fish/), [Open Liberty](https://openliberty.io/) or [Apache TomEE](http://tomee.apache.org/).

## Imixs-BPMN
Imixs-BPMN is an Eclipse modeling tool to design a business process based on the BPMN 2.0 standard. These models can be executed by the Imixs-Workflow engine.

Read more about Imixs-BPMN on the [project home](https://www.imixs.org/sub_modeler.html). 


## Imixs-RESTful API
Imixs-Workflow provides a RESTful API to integrate the Imixs-Workflow engine into a microservice architecture. In such an architecture the Imixs-Workflow engine can be deployed as a separate microservice managing human-centric workflow tasks. See the [Imixs-Microservice project](https://github.com/imixs/imixs-microservice) for more information.

The Imixs-Workflow engine runs also on Docker. The [Imixs-Microservice project](https://github.com/imixs/imixs-microservice) provides a full service stack for a microservice architecture running on Kubernetes or Docker-Swarm.
