# Imixs-Faces  Workflow Actions
The Imixs-Faces custom tag 'workflowactions' provides action toolbar based on the current workflow model. The tag can be used together with a workflowController component.
 
	<i:imixsWorkflowActions workflowController="#{workflowController}"
				disabletooltip="false" />
	 
This tag will automatically provide command buttons for each workflow activity defined in the current workflow model. The component used the workflowController to  dertermine the current workflow state. Each command button generated by this custom tag has the style class 'imixs-workflow-action'.   This class can be customized to change the design of the buttons. 
 
## Tooltips

The tooltip is rendered by the jQuery UI 'ToolTip' feature. To disable this feature use the attribute 'disabletooltip' 

 
	<i:imixsWorkflowActions workflowController="#{workflowController}"
			disabletooltip="false" />
